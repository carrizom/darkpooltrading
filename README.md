# Machine Learning For Institutional Advanced Order Recognition & Market Reaction Opportunities
## Introduction
Institutional financial firms use specialized orders and deep industry liquidity to fill asset trades at preferable rates and high volume. In this project, we will focus on dark-pool block trades, market-maker (MM) preferred trades, and hide-not-slide orders. All of these trading mechanisms are allowed and encouraged to an extent by central exchanges and regulators through lax regulation and skimpy enforcement of clearing laws due to technical loopholes in (international) trade execution venues. For instance, firms can delay reporting of billion-dollar trades for up to 48 hours by routing orders from New York to a British trade desk and back to the states for clearing. These practices, combined with other particular orders that bypass book liquidity (hide-not-slide, pegged, etc.) enable firms to conceal their market intentions and transact at away-from-market prices not available to the general public at the time of reporting. We intend to measure these sorts of trades and use machine learning to implement 0+ HFT and options-swing-trading algorithms to profit by mimicking "smart" investments and other specialized market opportunities based on hidden institutional trades.

## Motivation
We want to use machine learning to help identify smart investments and specialized market opportunities based on these "hidden" institutional trades. 

## Related Work
This type of work is done mostly by HFT firms and hedge funds and the information is not publicly available. However, we will be using dark-pool and specialized market-maker order trading strategies. 

## Dataset
Most of the financial market research is private and as a consequence there are not very many datasets available. We are currently in the process of gathering data through Bloomberg and Schwab that contains information from these "hidden trades" and creating our own data sets. 

## Methodology and Results
Implement Dark pools and specialized market-maker orders through neural networks.

## Risks 
There are not a lot of datasets available and related work is hardly available.

## What's New in Our Approach?
Using neural networks to implenet 0+ HFT and options-swing-trading algorithms. 

## Checks for Success
Our midterm "exam" is having a fully functioning deep learning algorithm and our final one will be identifying whether this algorithm was able to mimick good investment opportunities.
